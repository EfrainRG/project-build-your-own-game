## Project Description
The next project simulate the african game call it 'Oware'. 
I choose this project because in my first classes of programming, along with a friend, we did this game in _Turbo C_

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
This project was very challenging. Due to I discover the game is a constant _"call of functions"_, 
I decided to use functional programming in order to improve this topic. This was the order of function creation:
* Seedbeds creation _(General board)_
* Game rules & functionalities
* Give continuity to the game
* Main function where other functions are called

## Organization
In order to proof the functions, they were tested first in jupyter notebook after I copied in a py file.
